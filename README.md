# jifs: Java Iterated Function System


## Motivation
[Terafractal](https://www.matheasel.com/terafractal/mac/) is a beautiful Mac software for fractal generation. This is my translation to Java for a portable version with new features.  Accompanying this package is a jar executable that is similar to TeraFractal.

## TODO:
1. make gui
2. fix plotting range
